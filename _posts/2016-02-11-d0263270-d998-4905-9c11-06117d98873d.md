The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as "an
immense accumulation of commodities," \[1\] its unit being a single commodity. Our investigation must
therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity.
A commodity is, in the first place, an object outside us, a thing that by its properties satisfies human
wants of some sort or another. The nature of such wants, whether, for instance, they spring from the
stomach or from fancy, makes no difference. \[2\] Neither are we here concerned to know how the object
satisfies these wants, whether directly as means of subsistence, or indirectly as means of production.
Every useful thing, as iron, paper, &c., may be looked at from the two points of view of quality and
quantity. It is an assemblage of many properties, and may therefore be of use in various ways. To
discover the various uses of things is the work of history. \[3\] So also is the establishment of
socially-recognized standards of measure for the quantities of these useful objects. The diversity of these
measures has its origin partly in the diverse nature of the objects to be measured, partly in convention..
